Image Search Website using APIs-
Created an image gallery complete with front-end and back-end. Users will be able to search for images by keyword, and then save images to their Favorites list. Meanwhile, the server will handle all the communication to an external API, and then store the userâ€™s favorites in a MySQL database.
